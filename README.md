# Wine Quality Prediction
This project tries to build a classification Machine learning model to predict the quality of Wines.
We are required to use a Multiclass Linear Classification Model. 

## Content
This is a summary of what is included in the notebook.
- 1.Loading Data : We load our dataset with pandas.
- 2.Cleaning Data : We follow all the necessary steps to clean the data. Cleaning data means removing any null values duplicate rows redundant columns etc.
- 3.Exploratory data analysis to better understand the data.
- 4.Standardazation of Data : Since the data in columns varies widely in order for our model to perform better we try to standardize the data.
- 5.Building a Classification Model.
- 6.Analyzing results and doing Predictions :)

### Challenge
I would like to invite you guys for Contributing so that we can get a better model ( Using supervised ML Models only).
Feel free to take pull requests.
